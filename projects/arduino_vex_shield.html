           <p>The <a href="http://vexrobotics.com">VEX robotics design system</a> includes a lot of electronic motors and sensors that are nice and easy to use. Controlling them from an <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> microcontroller is not very complicated, but requires a lot of wire routing and power distribution that can turn a breadboard into a bird's nest. This shield takes care of routing the necessary power and signal pins to provide convenient 3-pin header connections that VEX components naturally plug in to.</p>

            <p>The board was designed in <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/">Eagle CAD V6.4</a>. This was my first Eagle CAD project to go from idea to finished design. The software is actually incredibly nice to use, once you learn the conventions of the interface. A compressed folder of the design files is available <a href="files/ArduinoVexShield.zip">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The bill of materials for this board is available <a href="files/VEX%20Shield%20BOM.pdf">here</a>. Estimated cost for components is $15.39. This does not include the cost of the printed PCB.<br/><b>NOTE</b>: The 5.1K and 150 ohm resistors in the parts list were selected as "close enough" to the desired 5K and 140 ohm resistors.</p>
