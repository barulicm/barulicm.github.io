            <h2 style="text-align:center">Crowd Traffic</h2>
           <p>A real-time traffic sensor web. This is a prototype based on the Android platform and using GPS/accelerometers to track real-time traffic conditions and record them in an online database to be viewed by other users.</p>
           <p>This app uses GPS data to track a drivers speed and direction and uses these data to inform an online database of traffic conditions. It is basically applying crowd-sourcing concepts to the problem of live, accurate traffic monitoring.</p>
           <p>This application was developmed as a summer internship project under the guidance of Professor WenZhan Song at Georgia State University's Sensorweb Research Laboratory. He has since moved to the <a href="http://sensorweb.engr.uga.edu/index.php/song/">University of Georgia</a>.</p>
            <p>The app is written in Java for Android smartphones. A server was set up with Google's App Engine service to run server-side Java code. <i>Crowd Traffic</i> was published on Google Play until 2013. The code for the Android app is available <a href="./files/CrowdTraffic_%20v2.zip">here</a>.</p>
